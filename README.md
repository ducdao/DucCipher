# CPE 102 - Project 2 - DucCipher

I went solo for this project.

The encryption for my project is assigning numbers to all lowercase and uppercase letters in the alphabet. (a = 1, b = 2, A = 27, etc.). The decryption reverses the process.

Program doesn't require any files. Follow the prompt when running the program.
